The notebook is divided into two parts, each focusing on a key application of **BERT**:

Part 1. Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Classification

  - Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the [stanfordnlp/IMDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/imdb) dataset for a **Binary Sentiment Classification** task.

Part 2. Inference for Question Answering

  - Perform inference using a pre-trained BERT model for a Question Answering (QA) task.
